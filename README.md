Using ML Lib on PySpark to predict the Academy Awards (Oscars) Best Picture winner for 2022

Using a dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martinmraz07/oscar-movies), which includes a list of all the Best Picture nominees in the entire history of the Academy Awards (better known as the Oscars), you can use ML Lib from Apache Spark to predict the best winner using variables such as: IMDB Ratings, Rotten Tomatoes rating, Movie Genre, Studio that produced movie, etc.

The machine learning models could also be developed using scikit learn, but this notebook uses ML Lib since it was created for a class project that required using Apache Spark.
